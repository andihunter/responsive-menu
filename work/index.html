            <h2>Marketing Intern for Hill Country Indoor</h2>
            <p>Hill Country Indoor (HCI) is a sports and fitness facility located In Bee Cave, Texas. I interned from April to June, 2021 in the marketing department under Marketing Director, Chelsea Pribble. I contributed to HCI by researching and compiling reports for the marketing and other departments, by creating various graphics for the HCI facility and social media pages, and by making updates to the HCI website using Wordpress.

            <h2>Social Media Intern for fudi</h2>
            <h3>Company Overview</h3>
            <p>I worked as a social media intern for fudi, a company that connects social media influencers with restaurants to create mutually beneficial relationships. Through their website and their social media, fudi allows influencers to schedule reservations with restaurants where they eat for free and create a promotion (story, post, pictures, etc.) based on what the restaurant specifies. The restaurants get exposure to all the influencer's followers and the influencers get a great meal on the house.
            </p>
            <h3>My Accomplishments</h3>
            <p>Throughout the course of my internship, I researched restaurants all over Utah and various other states to find great content to feature on fudi's Instagram page. I also became a "fudi" myself and was able to test the website for the company to determine bugs in the system and to create an informational Instagram story about how a partnership with fudi works. The next pages provide examples of the content I curated and the explanatory story highlight I created for the Instagram page.
            </p>
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>This internship required me to be a self-started because it was remote. I learned the importance of being disciplined and of creating a routine to ensure all work gets done on time. By the end of this 7 month internship, I raised the amount followers on fudi's Instagram by 7% and though I don't know how many restaurants/influencers joined due to my efforts, raising the followership is a huge accomplishment I'm proud of.

            <h2>Marketing Assistant for BYUtv</h2>
            <h3>Company Overview</h3>
            <p>I worked as a marketing assistant for BYUtv, a non- commercial, value-based television network that provides uplifting entertainment families can watch together.
            </p>
            <h3>My Accomplishments</h3>
            <p>As a marketing assistant, I assisted my boss in various capacities when needed.General tasks included formatting official documents for internal use, re-organizing department folders and folder structure in Box, and helping assemble conference press-kits. More specifically, I took part in a pre- screening event for a new show premiering Fall 2021, where I worked the watch party event and helped compile a report to illustrate the feedback from the pre-screening watch party attendees.
            </p>
            <p>On top of these general tasks, my main role was managing various social medias for various BYUtv shows. I became an expert on the shows I managed, created content and campaigns, including social media boosting, and analyzed various elements of our social media (number of followers, strength of engagement, how the numbers changed over time, which type of creative was most successful, etc.).</p>
            <p>The specific shows I managed were Random Acts and Making Good. I also co-managed Operation Awesome.
