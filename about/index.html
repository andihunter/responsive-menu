        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <article><h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Born in Sydney, Australia to Canadian parents, I am a proud tri- citizen who has never been in one place for too long. Though moving was never my first choice, living in many different places allowed me to become adaptable and great at making friends. Moving also allowed me to try so many things I otherwise never would have tried and ultimately lead me to my passion: advertising.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>From running my own piano studio to joining and competing in my high school's DECA (business) club to being an account manager In the BYU Adlab, advertising has always been a part of my life. Knowing how much I love advertising, I've worked in retail which taught me how to communicate well and provide good customer. I've interned and worked in various marketing positions which taught me all kinds of marketing skills. I've managed projects in the BYU Adlab, which taught me how to be a good manager. I've almost completed my advertising degree at BYU, with a minor In business both of which taught me so much about the business and advertising worlds.</p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>When I'm not advertising, I'm soaking up the sun, reading, watching movies, or spending time with my husband and friends. I also dabble In skateboarding, boxing, jewelry making, painting, and clothing customization when I get really bored which perfectly illustrates the fact that I cannot sit still!</p>
